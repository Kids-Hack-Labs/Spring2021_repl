Activity: Integrating the Snake class with the game

Task: Integrate the Snake.

Note: Navigate to the "src" folder and open the scene.py file. This is 
      where you will be coding this week

Specifications: 

At the very beginning of your scene.py file:

Import the Snake class from the snake module
    
    In the Scene's initializer:
        Create a score attribute and set it to zero
        
        Initialize a new snake attribute, set it to a Snake-type 
            variable. **Remember to provide it with the needed values!**
    
    In the Scene's start() method:
        Call the start() method of the snake attribute
    
    In the Scene's update() method:
        Call the update() method of the snake attribute. Do not forget to pass
            delta as an argument
    
    In the Scene's render() mehtod:
        Calll the render() method of the fruit attribute. Do not forget to
            pass target as an argument
            
    Create a method called collect(). It should take no arguments apart from 
        self
        
        If the collectible attribute's cell is in the same spot as the 
            attribute snake's head:
            
            Call the snake attribute's set_growth() method.
            
            While the collectible attribute's current cell is in the snake:
                call the collectible attribute's reposition() method
            
            Increase the score attribute by 1
