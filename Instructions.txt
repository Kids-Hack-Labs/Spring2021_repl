Activity: Creating the Scene class

Task: Implement a simple scene class.

Note: Navigate to the "src" folder and open the scene.py file. This is where
      you will be coding this week

Specifications: 
The game's engine expects the Scene to be a custom data type with a few
specific attributes and methods.

NOTE: Attributes should be created in the class's initializer!

Attributes:
    - started: This attribute tells the game whether the Scene was initialized
               successfully. Its data type is boolean, and it should be
               initialized to False.
Methods:
    - start(): This method checks whether the class variables were properly
               initialized, and returns the current initialization state of 
               the Scene. For now, all we do is set started to True and 
               return it.
    - update(): This method takes one argument (delta) and is responsible for
                the scene's updates. For now, it should be an empty-bodied
                method
    - render(): This method takes one argument (target) and is responsible for
                drawing the Scene on the game's screen (target).

Once these attributes and methods are implmemented, create another attribute 
named colour and assign it a tuple with three elements. These elements should
be integers in the range 0 - 255.

In the render method, fill the target with the Scene's colour.

Run your code to test it.
